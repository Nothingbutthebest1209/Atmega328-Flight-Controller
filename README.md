# Atmega328-Flight-Controller
A  Flight Controller board for a quadcopter based on YMFC Joop Brokking's code.


This is the read me file of the Atmega328-Flight Controller project , which is my contrubution to the OPEN SOURCE community .The board was developed by LAB619 Engineering & Consulting Services which is a tech company based in Tunisia that is specialized in custom machine fabrication and embedded solution developement, the company is also specialized in developing IoT solution (LoRa, GPRS and WiFi),PCB and mechanical design .
You can check the website for further information: 

This board is a basic flight controller based on the Atmega328 MCU 
The control of those machines is done by using their native USB interface or their Ethernet interface , the project will play the role of anew interface to the Machines that helps the end user to use this machines remotly and also allow the fab manager to have a calendar of the machine usage as well as keeping the tracking of the maintenance dates. 

This interface is a PCB, based on an MCU that also have a wifi interface in order to connect to the internet to fetch data (reservation of the Machines and G-Codes), and also to publish data regarding the usage of the machine and those who worked on .

**Note:** ***This repository is reserveed for hte hardware part of this project , as well as the emedded software of the project.***
